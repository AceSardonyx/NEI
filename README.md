# Not Enough Interest - A MC Mod of The Mind & Soul
With distant lands and mystical creatures, there are many special things to find so long as you keep your interest.
Losing curiosity may result in failure! So be careful!

This mod is for 1.18.2
I recommend optifine and an infinite render distance mod.
You can also include quark, biomesoplenty, & more if you'd like. [Shaders are also highly recommended.](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads)

To download, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/AceSardonyx/NEI/releases) section!

Special thanks to Del for helping make this & the Shadotics texture pack, and to Hasco and the previous creators that Hasco used assets from.
About? - NEI is an addon that came from bedrock which focused on magical and soul aspects and has been discontinued by Hasco.
We are making a java port of the mod now which includes new features that enhance the gameplay!
